#description: The script syncs members between a specified MS Teams TEAM and an Active Directory Group. 
#Removing members from a MS Teams TEAM is an optional flag <WithRemove>
#optional <TestOnly> Flag can be used to do a test run from sync to get a report of changes and a CSV lists of AD and MS Teams TEAM current members.

#usage: teams_ad_user_sync.ps1 <Team Group ID> <Active Directory Group that contain Members to add or remove from MS Teams TEAM> <WithRemove flag>
#example: c:\sw_nt\Git\msteams-helper\teams_ad_user_sync.ps1 "1f6cded9-2277-49d6-8d5c-2ec7fc9d6639" "CSNRIMIT" "WithRemove" "TestOnly"

## DEPENDENCIES Install powershell modules via powershell prompt (this took way too long, requires admin access):
#Install-Module -Name MicrosoftTeams
#Install-module Microsoft.Graph

##This may be a one time step, to allow powershell via the device:
#Connect-Graph
 
##Connect to MS Teams this is required on session startup"
#Connect-MicrosoftTeams

## HELPER COMANDS
## Find the Team (I sniffed my web traffic to find the GroupID for the IIT All staff Team)
#Get-TeamChannel -GroupId 1f6cded9-2277-49d6-8d5c-2ec7fc9d6639  
## Lists all the users in the Teams Channel:
# Get-TeamUser -GroupId 1f6cded9-2277-49d6-8d5c-2ec7fc9d6639

$TeamGroupID=$args[0]

$TestOnly=$args[3]

write-host "This script will read a list of members in the Active Directory Group $ADGroup and sync them to the MS Team $TeamGroupID " 
 
## Add user's email from an LDAP group in powershell â€“ do a loop of users and feed the userid into this command:

#builds a CSV list of emails in the given MS Teams Team (recursively into sub groups too)
