#description: The scripts can do two things: ADD or REMOVE a list of members within an AD Group to/from a MS Teams TEAM.

#usage: teams_ad_user_sync.ps1 <Team Group ID> <Active Directory Group than contain Members to add or remove from MS Teams TEAM> <WithRemove flag>
#example: c:\sw_nt\Git\msteams-helper\teams_ad_user_sync.ps1 "1f6cded9-2277-49d6-8d5c-2ec7fc9d6639" "CSNRIMIT" "WithRemove"

## 1. Install powershell modules via powershell prompt (this took way too long, requires admin access):
#Install-Module -Name MicrosoftTeams
#Install-module Microsoft.Graph
 
## 2.	This may be a one time step, to allow powershell via the device:
#Connect-Graph
 
## 3.	Connect to MS Teams"
#Connect-MicrosoftTeams

## 4.	Find the Team (I sniffed my web traffic to find the GroupID for the IIT All staff Team)
#Get-TeamChannel -GroupId 1f6cded9-2277-49d6-8d5c-2ec7fc9d6639  

## 5.	Lists all the users in the Teams Channel:
# Get-TeamUser -GroupId 1f6cded9-2277-49d6-8d5c-2ec7fc9d6639
 
## 6.	Add user's email from an LDAP group in powershell â€“ do a loop of users and feed the userid into this command:
##Active Directory call: *you would have to do a recursive loop to get users and groups within the AD group
##https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/addsadministration/get-adgroupmember?view=win10-ps
#Get-AdGroupMember -identity "CSNRIMIT"  
##https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/444390-get-adgroupmembers-emails

#builds a CSV list of emails in the given AD Group (recursively into sub groups too)
$filenameFormat = "ADList"+$ADGroup+"_"+$TeamGroupID+"_"+$ACTION +"_"+ (Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd") + ".csv"
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity $ADGroup  -Recursive | Get-ADUser -Properties Mail | Select-Object Mail | Export-CSV -Path $filenameFormat  -NoTypeInformation

#builds a CSV list of emails in the given MS Teams Team (recursively into sub groups too)
$teamlistFormat = "TeamList"+$ADGroup+"_"+$TeamGroupID+"_"+$ACTION +"_"+ (Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd") + ".csv"
Get-TeamUser -GroupId $TeamGroupID | Select-Object User | Export-CSV -Path $teamlistFormat  -NoTypeInformation

## 7.	The command in the recursive loop: (note previous step deals with the recursive issue)
##https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/teams/add-teamuser?view=teams-ps
# Add-TeamUser -GroupId 1f6cded9-2277-49d6-8d5c-2ec7fc9d6639 -User Kevin.Netherton@gov.bc.ca  

$mail_list = Import-Csv $filenameFormat
$team_list = Import-Csv $teamlistFormat
$i = 0
$team_addlist = $mail_list | ? { $team_list.User -notcontains $_."Mail" } 

# adds users from a CSV generated from the AD Group list
foreach ($member in $team_addlist) {
       #Add-TeamUser -GroupId $TeamGroupID -User $($member.Mail)
       Write-Host "Add-TeamUser -GroupId $TeamGroupID -User $($member.Mail)"
      $i++  
}

$r = 0
$team_removelist = $team_list | ? { $mail_list.Mail -notcontains $_."User" } 

#removes users from the MS Teams TEAM if they are not found in the CSV/AD Group list
if($Action -eq "WithRemove") {
    foreach ($teammember in $team_removelist) {
        #Remove-TeamUser -GroupId $TeamGroupID -User $($member.Mail)
        Write-Host "Remove-TeamUser -GroupId $TeamGroupID -User $($teammember.User)"
        $r++
    }
 }

Write-Host "There were $i members added to the MS Teams $TeamGroupID" 
Write-Host "There were $r members removed from the MS Teams $TeamGroupID"
