#description: This powershell script syncs members between a specified MS Teams TEAM and a specified Active Directory Group.
#             NOTE: The Active Directory Group is considered the authoritative membership to base all changes off of, now changes to the AD Group will occur with this script.
#             <WithRemove> is an optional flag for removing members from a MS Teams TEAM (ie. leave out if you only want to ADD users)
#             <TestOnly or Update> is a flag that can be used to do a test run for a sync, to get a report of potential changes, and to create CSV lists of AD and MS Teams TEAM current members.

#usage:     teams_ad_user_sync.ps1 <Team Group ID> <Active Directory Group that contain Members to add or remove from MS Teams TEAM> <WithRemove flag> <TestOnly or Update flag>
#example:   teams_ad_user_sync.ps1 "1f6cded9-2277-49d6-8d5c-2ec7fc9d6639" "CSNRIMIT" "WithRemove" "TestOnly"

##     **** NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED ONCE ON DEVICE **** DEPENDENCIES 
##     Install powershell modules via powershell prompt (this took way too long, requires admin access):
#Install-Module -Name MicrosoftTeams
#Install-module Microsoft.Graph

##     **** NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED ONCE ON DEVICE **** 
##     This may be a one time step, to allow powershell via the device:
#Connect-Graph
 
##     **** NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED ONCE ON DEVICE PER SESSION **** 
##     Connect to MS Teams this is required on session startup - 
#Connect-MicrosoftTeams

## HELPER COMANDS
##     Find the Team (I sniffed my web traffic to find the GroupID for the IIT All staff Team)
#Get-TeamChannel -GroupId 1f6cded9-2277-49d6-8d5c-2ec7fc9d6639  
##     Lists all the users in the Teams Channel:
# Get-TeamUser -GroupId 1f6cded9-2277-49d6-8d5c-2ec7fc9d6639
